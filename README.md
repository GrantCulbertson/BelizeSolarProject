# BelizeSolarProject

Authors: Richard Alvarez, (....)

Website for Belize Solar data for software development and design homework 7

Goal: Create a responsive web page.

The data is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhXcbkrk1JekFlCHPpZr_mavFl_XUg0e9h4HGTEOAKA/edit)

What your team will do is:
- create a main page, to provide information on the project. 
- a set of sub pages for each school

It should be nice looking, and include buttons and/or pull down menus to navigate.
