# BelizeSolarProject

A website to monitor Solar Data from schools in Belize. 

SCMP 318 Spring 2023 at Kenyon College.

The data is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhXcbkrk1JekFlCHPpZr_mavFl_XUg0e9h4HGTEOAKA/edit)

Out team will:
- create a main page, to provide information on the project. 
- a set of sub pages for each school

It should be nice looking, and include buttons and/or pull down menus to navigate.
